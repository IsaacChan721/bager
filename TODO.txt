#SERVER SIDE
#Append a random string as a room key when /setup is accessed
    #Save this string somewhere to avoid conflicts
    #Implementation: append querystring first and then forward to proxy?

#Adjust ws controller to send to the same room it came from
#Design a heartbeat function to constantly relay the latest data to all clients
#Detect player disconnects

#CLIENT SIDE
#When first connecting, send initial data (name and avatar) and retrieve current data (Settings / Players)
    #Subscripe to the correct room
#On interactions with avatar, name or settings, publish new data to the server
    #Note, maybe only let 1 person touch the settings


#GAME LOOP
#Select a player
#Player chooses a word
#Draws while people guess
#Finish and pass play to next player
